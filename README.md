# DMR_VisionServer

This is a basic vision server for use with Intel RealSense cameras (F200 Tested) built on top of PCL (pointclouds.org) and the RS link to PCL by taketwo.

**This is a personal project and as such is not documented yet, if you are interested please get in touch and I'll get a doc up and running**
